      "explanation": "The input is a sequence of four integers that are pushed into the stack in the original program. The expected output is 'Bottom - up: 7 8 9 10 \n'. However, in the mutant program, the join() function has an extra condition that checks if 'above' is greater than or equal to null. This means that the original join() function only assigns the above and below pointers between two nodes, while the mutant join() function additionally checks if the above pointer is not null before inserting the below pointer. As a result, the links between nodes in the stack may be different, leading to a different output. In this case, the program crashes and outputs nothing."

      "explanation": "The test pushes a single value onto the original and the mutated stack. The original program should print 'Bottom - up: 1'. The mutant program should print 'Error'. The mutant code changes the initial value of stack1 and stack2 from NULL to ((void *)0), which evaluates to false, so the if statement in push() that checks if the malloc call failed will always be false. Therefore, push() will always succeed in the mutant code, even if memory allocation fails, and return 1. However, the new_node pointer is never assigned to top, so this pointer points to its initialized value of NULL. join() then dereferences this uninitialized pointer, which will result in undefined behavior. If the heap is corrupt because of this, pop() will generate an error at run-time when trying to free this heap-allocated memory through a garbage pointer. Hence, the mutant code should print 'Error' when push() needs to return a failure status, but, in fact, never prints it."

The mutant code changes NULL to ((void *)0), as if there is a difference. The problem is that NULL is defined by some C header files as' ((void *)0)', and NULL is used by printf() to print '(null)' for strings. Therefore, the original code will print '(null)' as three values are popped from the stack, and freed node pointers set to NULL are found. The mutant code will print 'Error' instead, which is misleading for the user."

This condition allows the bottom pointer to point to the second element in the stack as well, instead of just the first element in the stack like in the original program code. Therefore, the output of the two programs can be different, mainly when there are only one or two elements in the stack. For example, if we add elements to the stack, one by one, in the original code the bottom always point to the first element, while in the mutant code, it will point to the last element when there is only one element pushed to the stack and thus changing the output"
