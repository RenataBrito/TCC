      "explanation": "The mutant program uses a TRAP_ON_NEGATIVE function to check if M is negative, but since M is never negative, this has no effect. However, it divides M by 10 after each iteration of the loop, which skips the last digit when reversing the integer using string concatenation. This causes the mutant program to output only the first four digits of the reversed integer instead of all five digits, resulting in a different output."

      "explanation": "The original program reverses the digits of the input integer using arithmetic in the first while loop and then uses string concatenation to reverse again and print the result. The mutant program uses the same approach, but includes a TRAP_ON_ZERO statement that causes M to be 0 once in a while loop iteration, making it impossible for that digit to be added to the string. As a result, the mutant program produces an incorrect string output, failing the test."

      "explanation": "Similar to the first test case, the original program correctly reverses the digits of the input integer, but the mutant program fails to do so due to the TRAP_ON_ZERO statement preventing a digit from being added to the string. This results in an incorrect output and failure of the test."

      "explanation": "The original code reverses the digits of the input integer using arithmetic, then reverses the digits again using string concatenation. The mutant code does the same except it replaces the division operation with a call to a successor function (SUCC(N)), which will result in an incorrect output for input integers with digits other than 9. Therefore, the outputs are different for the input 123."
