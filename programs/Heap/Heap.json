The mutant program modifies the 'exch' function to include a macro function called 'TRAP_ON_ZERO(i)', which ultimately increments i before accessing an array. This changes the original behavior of the 'exch' function and swaps every value with a wrong one, compromising the outcome of the heap sorting by the 'sort' method. The test shows that when the input to the original code has a length greater or equal to 2, the output is '***************** Sorted Strings *****************\n' followed by the lexicographically sorted elements, each of them with quotes. The test demonstrates that the first test input has 'a', 'b', and 'c' as elements in any order, and produces a lexicographically sorted output when run with the original program. In contrast, the same input runs with the mutant program and generates a lexicographically sorted output different from the previous. Therefore, the programs are not equivalent."

The mutant changes the condition in line 23 so that j and j+1 are compared only if (j - N) is true, causing only j+1 to be compared when j == N. This breaks the heap invariant because j+1 may be greater than j. This condition throws a warning 'comparison of integers of different signs' because j-N is an integer and less than j+1; In this test case the conditional is satisfied several times, causing the strings 'p' and 'h' to be inverted in the output of the mutated program."

TRAP_ON_NEGATIVE is a hypothetical function that should return 1 for i=1 and 2 otherwise; however, it does not exist and thus causes undefined behavior.
