The original 'less01' function represents lexicographic comparison properly by comparing the strings (pq[i-1], pq[j-1]) passed as arguments. However, the mutant 'less01' function calculates the indexes starting from 0 for the first string and from 1 for the second string, which causes the 1st element to be compared to the 2nd element instead of the 0th element leading to different sorting order. Thus, the mutant and the original code differ for some input strings. This input test case checks for correct sorting in lexicographically sorted order"}, {"input": ["all", "bad", "bed", "bug", "dad", "yes", "zoo"], "original_output": 1, "mutant_output": 0, "explanation": "Similar to the previous case, this case also tests lexicographic order of strings for correct sorting. The mutant function 'less01' calculated indices starting from 0 and 1 leading to different elements being compared that lead to a different sorting order than expected. The expected output is a list of given strings sorted alphabetically as per their order in the English language.

The expected output from original 'Heap' program is lexicographically sorted strings of input strings in order.
