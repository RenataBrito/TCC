This is because the mutant program only sets the result to 1 when right is equal to 1, but in the original program it sets the result to 1 when right is equal to 0. Thus, a test where right is greater than 1 will result in different outputs."}, {"input": [5, 0], "original_output": 1, "mutant_output": 1, "explanation": "Both programs correctly return 1 when right is equal to 0."}, {"input": [2, 1], "original_output": 2, "mutant_output": 1, "explanation": "Both programs correctly return the value of left when right is equal to 1."}]}]
